David Maisel's <a href="http://www.davidmaisel.com/works/picture.asp?cat=lod&amp;tl=library%20of%20dust" target="_blank">Library of Dust</a> consists of photographs of copper canisters containing the cremated remains of patients at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Hospital" target="_blank">state-run psychiatric hospital</a> (the same one where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%E2%80%99s_Nest" target="_blank">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a> was filmed). These initially plain and utilitarian urns are now bursting with color and texture as the ashes have interacted with the metals over the decades, imparting uniqueness and personality in defiance of their anonymity.

<p>The <a href="http://www.eigenlabs.com" target="_blank">Eigenharp</a> is a new electronic performance instrument designed to maximize expressive control of modern virtual software instruments. It has 120 keys arranged in a 5x24 grid, each of which can register 2048 levels of pressure in 3 dimensions. This means you could play a chord with your left hand, and use each finger to simultaneously alter the pitch, volume, and expression of each note of the chord (or any other parameters of your choice). That leaves your other hand free to play a drum rhythm on the 12 additional percussion keys, or to use another part of the keyboard as a programmable looping pattern sequencer. There's also a mouthpiece for breath control, two ribbon expression controllers on the sides, LED indicators on each key, etc. Check out the video of the product launch at <a href="http://www.sonicstate.com/news/2009/10/06/eigenharp-officially-relased-first-look-video/" target="_blank">Sonic State</a>, or learn more at <a href="http://www.eigenlabs.com" target="_blank">Eigenlabs</a>' website.</p>

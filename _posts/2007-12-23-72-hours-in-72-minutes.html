Director <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~luke/" title="R. Luke Dubois" target="_blank">R. Luke Dubois</a> spent three days filming actress <a href="http://lianamaris.com/" target="_blank">Lian Amaris Sifuentes</a> moving in extreme slow motion on a set in the street near New York's Union Square, made to look like an old-fashioned boudoir.Â  Her performance, in which she goes through the ritual of preparing for a date, will be digitally sped up by sixty times and shown as a <a href="http://www.fashionablylatefortherelationship.com/" target="_blank">feature-length film</a>, such that the actress appears to move at a regular pace while city life races by in the background.  New digital processing techniques are used which result in smooth motion, unlike the normal fast-forward that we are used to.  Scheduled for exhibition in galleries and on HD-DVD in 2008.

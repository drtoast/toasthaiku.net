I was sitting in a nicely furnished living room with Joan Collins and some guy I didn't know (I assumed he was a friend of Joan). We were all armed with automatic weapons, and we were calmly firing blanks at each other's heads.

Now, this house was built on one of those circular iceplant-filled areas inside of a freeway onramp, so out of all the windows we had a view of the surrounding stop-and-go traffic. The outer perimeter of the onramp was lined with enormous state-owned bookcases filled with enormous state-owned books (I knew they were put there because the onramp is state property, obviously). I only read the title of one of the enormous books (about 4 inches wide by 4 feet high), and the title was "Meat Loaf Recipes of the Old West".

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_b_cooper" title="Wikipedia article" target="_blank">D. B. Cooper</a> was the alias of a man who hijacked a Boeing 727 in 1972 and then disappeared after parachuting out of the plane. The dapper man in a crisp suit passed a note to a flight attendant claiming he had a bomb in his suitcase. He demanded $200,000 in unmarked $20 bills, and four parachutes. After the plane landed and officials met his demands, he released the passengers and told the crew to take the plane back into the air. Then, somewhere over the Pacific Northwest, he opened the rear stairway of the plane and, strapped into a parachute and clutching the briefcase full of cash, leapt into a furious rainstorm, never to be seen again. It is unknown if he survived the jump, but in 1980 about $5000 of the bills he had been given by the FBI were found in the mud on the banks of the Columbia river. It is not known if they were buried or just washed up there.</p>

<p>Dmitry Maksimov works in a variety of styles and media, but I'm most fascinated by his photo illustrations that show small characters going about their mysterious business in realistic settings with narrow depth-of-field. It's a fleeting glimpse into a cute and spooky world. Visit <a href="http://tebe-interesno.livejournal.com" title="Dmitry Maksimov" target="_blank">the artist's site</a> (it's in Russian, but just scroll down for the images).</p>

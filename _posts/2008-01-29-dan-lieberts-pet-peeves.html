<ul>
	<li>Itchy labels on bungee ankle straps so I itch the whole way down</li>
	<li>People on fireâ€”they're always asking for favors, even if they hardly know you</li>
	<li>When my opera cape gets caught on homeless people's junk</li>
	<li>When a woman stands near me and people think her ugly baby is mine and it is</li>
	<li>See the rest at <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2008/1/28liebert.html" target="_blank">McSweeney's.</a></li>

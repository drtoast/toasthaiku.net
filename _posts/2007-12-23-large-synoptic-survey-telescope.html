The <a href="http://www.lsst.org/" target="_blank">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a> will collect 90 terabytes of images of the whole night sky every three days using a 3-billion-pixel camera, in order to detect faint long-term astronomical changes, or rapid changes that we don't normally see because we were looking at the wrong part of the sky at the time.Â  The 8.4 meter LSST is scheduled to go online in 2013.

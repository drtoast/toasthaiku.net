<p>So Bruce is the lead singer for this heavy metal band called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden" title="Iron Maiden on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Iron Maiden</a>, which was pretty big in the 80's but is still rocking out today. As if being the lead singer for Iron Maiden wasn't awesome enough, Bruce was also really into fencing and competed internationally, and started his own <a href="http://ww.duellist.com" title="Duellist" target="_blank">fencing equipment company</a>. And as if being the lead singer of Iron Maiden and being a top international fencer wasn't awesome enough, Bruce also decided to become an airline pilot and now flies Boeing 757 jets for a <a href="http://www.flystar.com" title="Astraeus" target="_blank">UK charter airline</a>. Then, in a final coup de awesome, he had a 757 <a href="http://blogto.com/city/2008/03/iron_maiden_land_in_toronto/" title="Bruce's plane" target="_blank">painted with the Iron Maiden logo</a>, climbed into the pilot's seat, and flew his band on their world tour. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_dickinson" title="Bruce on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Bruce Dickinson</a>, you're awesome.</p>

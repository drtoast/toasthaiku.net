<a href="http://www.rangefuels.com/">Range Fuels</a> is building the world's first commerical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" target="_blank">cellulosic ethanol</a> plant in Georgia, producing 100 million gallons per year. Cellulosic ethanol makes use of normally discarded plant material, such as the husks and stalks from corn, or easily grown switch grass.  The process creates 16 times more energy than is required to create it, vs only 1.3 times for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_ethanol" target="_blank">corn ethanol</a>, which only uses the kernels of the corn. The plant should be online in 2008. (via <a href="http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/07/05/range-fuels-building-the-nations-first-commercial-cellulosic-et/">AutoBlogGreen</a>)

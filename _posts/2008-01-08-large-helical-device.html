In addition to being the most awesome-looking piece of machinery I have ever seen, the <a href="http://www.lhd.nifs.ac.jp/en/home/lhd.html" title="Large Helical Device official site" target="_blank">Large Helical Device</a> is billed as the "largest superconducting stellarator in the world".  This Japanese fusion research device consists of intertwined coils of superconducting material, and is designed to contain a 100-million-degree nuclear fusion plasma.  The research aims to solve the many engineering challenges that must be overcome in order for fusion reactors to produce more energy than they consume.

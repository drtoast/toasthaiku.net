I was rudely awakened by little bits of the ceiling falling on my bed. Apparently my upstairs neighbors were doing some "improvements" and were creating a widening hole in the ceiling and adjacent wall above me.

I quickly stumbled out of bed. My bleary eyes watched as the rapidly widening hole started to reveal the structural skeleton of the building, and light began to stream through the gaps.

Soon the hole was large enough that an abalone fisherwoman in a wetsuit was able to fall through.

She was as surprised as I was.

<p>Music software company <a href="http://www.celemony.com" target="_blank">Celemony</a> has announced the latest version of their pitch correction software, <a href="http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=dna" title="Melodyne DNA" target="_blank">Melodyne</a>. While it's been possible for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_correction" title="pitch correction on Wikipedia" target="_blank">quite some time</a> to use software to correct or change an individual note in a recorded melody, until now it's only been able to do that with a monophonic melody, meaning only one note is playing at a time, such as a voice or a flute. The breakthrough is that they've finally made it possible to actually access all of the notes in a polyphonic recording, such as a strumming guitar or a chorus of voices. The software extracts each note and displays it in a grid, where time goes from left to right and pitch goes from bottom to top. You can then select each individual note with your mouse and move it up or down in pitch, forward or backwards in time, adjust it louder or quieter in volume. You can use this as a tool to make subtle corrections, or <a href="http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=dna_intro3" target="_blank">create a whole new piece</a> with the same instrument. Check out the <a href="http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=dna" title="Melodyne DNA" target="_blank">video</a> to see it in action (and forgive the poor voiceover announcer for not knowing how to pronounce "monophonic" or "MIDI").</p>

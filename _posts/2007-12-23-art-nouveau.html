I just bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/383313545X" target="_blank">this book</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau" target="_blank">Art Nouveau</a>.  This turn-of-the-century style is marked by its bold, organic, flowing lines and intricate ornamentation, and has had a strong influence on modern graphic design.  The stems of flowers and vines are prominent - in fact, Art Nouveau has even been called "stem style." The work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucha" target="_blank">Alfons Mucha</a>, with its radiant, neoclassical women with flowing robes and hair that almost resembles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_knot" target="_blank">celtic knotwork</a>, is quintessential Art Nouveau.

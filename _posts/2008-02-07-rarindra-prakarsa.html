<p>Indonesian photographer <a href="http://photo.net/photodb/member-photos?user_id=2231437&amp;include=all" target="_blank">Rarindra Prakarsa</a> conjures magical vignettes of misty rainforests, with sunbeams peaking through to illuminate his characters from behind like scenes from a fairy tale. I suspect there's more than a little photoshopping going on here, but the result is breathtaking.</p>

<p>French composer <a href="http://www.pierrebastien.com/" target="_blank">Pierre Bastien</a> builds small mechanical musical devices, which click and whirr and play somber melodies on keyboards as he follows along on his muted trumpet, occasionally reaching over to adjust a lever or attach a new part. It's an intimate and introspective affair.</p>

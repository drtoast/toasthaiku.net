<p>Silicon Valley company <a href="http://luxim.com" title="Luxim" target="_blank">Luxim</a> has created the most efficient light source yet, at 140 lumens (units of light output) per watt. For comparison, today's most efficient LEDs only produce 70 lumens per watt, and a normal incandescent bulb produces a measly 15. They have produced a bulb the size of a Tic Tac that produces as much light as a street lamp using a fraction of the power. They use an electrical charge tightly focused into a small capsule of argon gas. The argon turns into a 6000 degree plasma, as hot as the surface of the sun - which is the reason why the light it emits has the same spectrum as natural sunlight.

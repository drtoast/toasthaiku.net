<p>This is just too cool for words. One winter day in New York City, 207 people casually wandered into Grand Central Station. At exactly 2:30 pm, they all <a href="http://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central/://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central/" target="_blank">froze in place</a> like statues, confusing the many bystanders and official-looking people around them. Exactly 5 minutes later, they all continued on with their business as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The performance was organized by a group called <a href="http://www.improveverywhere.com" target="_blank">Improv Everywhere</a>, which has pulled off <a href="http://www.improveverywhere.com/2004/07/24/synchronized-swimming/" target="_blank">many such stunts</a> over the past several years. The photos, obviously, don't do it justice - so be sure to <a href="http://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central/" target="_blank">watch the video</a> to get the full effect.</p>

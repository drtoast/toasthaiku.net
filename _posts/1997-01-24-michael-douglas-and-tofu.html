I was working as a temp for Michael Douglas at a large corporation, doing research on using tofu as a meat substitute in cooking. As I was chasing after Mr. Douglas with my stack of notes, I ran into Julia Roberts. Then it occurred to me that this must be the making of a movie.

"Hello, Miss Roberts," I said politely, in awe of her greatness.

"Please, it's Julia," she answered with a smile.

"This movie flopped, didn't it? I've never heard of it before," I said.

"Actually, it's still being made," she answered.

I felt like such an idiot.

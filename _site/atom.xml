   <content type="html">This is really beautiful. A piece of red fabric floats and dances in a vortex of wind created by a circle of fans. The longer you watch it, the more it seems to be moving on its own, like a dancer.

   <content type="html">In the spirit of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://toasthaiku.net/2009/02/07/ligher-in-a-blender/&quot;&gt;slow-motion exploding lighter in a blender&lt;/a&gt;, here's a video of a match lighting at 2000 frames per second. It takes 2 1/2 minutes to finish lighting!

   <content type="html">NASA has released this 45-minute compilation of space shuttle launches filmed at up to 400 frames per second from various angles.  You can see plumes of hydrogen gas billow and ignite, explosive bolts releasing boosters from the platform, and chunks of ice tumbling slowly.

   <title>Sea Monster Attack Litigation</title>
   <link href="http://toasthaiku.net/2010/03/21/sea-monster-attack-litigation.html"/>
   <updated>2010-03-21T17:40:47-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2010/03/21/sea-monster-attack-litigation</id>
   <content type="html">At the Law Offices of Lynch &amp;amp; Reynolds, we specialize in representing the victims of personal injury resulting from sea monster attack. At a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.false-profit.com/2010/03/20/to-the-docks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;symposium for sea monster experts&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco, we handed out a questionnaire to potential clients. We present here the data we gathered, as well as the harrowing tales of nautical woe from the victims themselves.
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2010/03/survey.png&quot; alt=&quot;survey.png&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Clearly the Caspian sea, with 24% of all attacks, is the most sea-monster-saturated of all the seven seas, followed by the Mediterranean and Adriatic. 15% of victims appear to have been sufficiently disoriented by their traumatic experiences that they can't even remember which sea they were in at the time. The Persian Gulf appears by far to be the safest of all the seas with regard to the risk of sea monster attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2010/03/which-sea.png&quot; alt=&quot;which sea.png&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;327&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Sea-monster-attack victims are a salty lot, judging by the fact that 67% of them had been at sea more than 90 months before being attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2010/03/months-at-sea.png&quot; alt=&quot;months at sea.png&quot; width=&quot;459&quot; height=&quot;328&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And these sailors appear to have brought plenty of Sunny-D with them, as scurvy rates were quite low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2010/03/scurvy.png&quot; alt=&quot;scurvy.png&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Over 40% of attacking sea monsters have more than 15 tentacles. From this we can conclude that they are really, really scary. This undoubtedly contributes to the undue mental anguish our clients endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2010/03/tentacles.png&quot; alt=&quot;tentacles.png&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And here we present the collected stories of the surveyed victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Mary Prankster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Having been contracted to kill an infestation of sea monsters in the Caspian, I was attacked and severely tentacled.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Captain Smarmy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;I done been sailin' da sea when all of a sudden dis creature came outta nowheres and attacked me ship. We grabbed all our pokin' sticks and poked that monster back into da sea!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Mermaid Raven An&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;I was sunning my bare breasts on a warm, smooth stone. A wry tentacle snaked up and whipped my mer-buns. Who knows what will happen next time?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Captain T.J. Honker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;While pillaging Her Majesty's fine goods, I and me crew was unprovokedly tentacled, and we lost some o' our booty! And also, I lost me arm, but I got three o' his!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Ambulanceboat Chaser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;It all happened so fast! I am very traumatized. No, these bite marks are not sharpied.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Brendan O'Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;I was walking on a jogging path, having disembarked from a treacherous journey across the Arabian Sea in a rather large fishing vessel when a spiteful kraken, who'd followed us across the sea but was unable to attack due to the vessel's size, lurched from the water to snarch my baby Elliot from my clutches.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;It was just after dawn. There were sea monsters in the valley. 'Nuff said.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Merstrom&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Peaceful trans-Red Sea migration interrupted by attack, coordinated by three creatures with intent to capture (and kill?), narrow escape, loss of five scales on right hip.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle Oak&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;We were just enjoying a delightful Sunday afternoon on the boat when a dreadful tentacle appeared over the starboard bow. I can't even go on...&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ballantyne&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Surfing and then ZOMG SEA MONSTER. Luckily caught a fat tube that took me to safety but my board was ruined. Seeking damages to property and mental suffering.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Sour Scrat&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Awkward.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>The Eigenharp</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eigenlabs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eigenharp&lt;/a&gt; is a new electronic performance instrument designed to maximize expressive control of modern virtual software instruments. It has 120 keys arranged in a 5x24 grid, each of which can register 2048 levels of pressure in 3 dimensions. This means you could play a chord with your left hand, and use each finger to simultaneously alter the pitch, volume, and expression of each note of the chord (or any other parameters of your choice). That leaves your other hand free to play a drum rhythm on the 12 additional percussion keys, or to use another part of the keyboard as a programmable looping pattern sequencer. There's also a mouthpiece for breath control, two ribbon expression controllers on the sides, LED indicators on each key, etc. Check out the video of the product launch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonicstate.com/news/2009/10/06/eigenharp-officially-relased-first-look-video/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sonic State&lt;/a&gt;, or learn more at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eigenlabs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eigenlabs&lt;/a&gt;' website.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no percussion or meter, so things will always blend together smoothly no matter when you start or stop each video. Try to resist the urge to play them all at once - turn on a couple at a time, then add new ones as time goes on. The effect is incredibly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 1969, a 14-year-old Beatle fanatic named Jerry Levitan, armed with a reel-to-reel tape deck, snuck into John Lennon's hotel room in Toronto and convinced John to do an interview about peace. 38 years later, Jerry has produced a film about it. Using the original interview recording as the soundtrack, director Josh Raskin has woven a visual narrative which tenderly romances Lennon's every word in a cascading flood of multipronged animation.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Best. Lake. Ever. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lake Baikal&lt;/a&gt;, in southern Siberia in Russia, contains over 20% of the world's fresh water and is home to over 1700 species of plants and animals, of which two thirds are found nowhere else. Although less than half the surface area of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lake Superior&lt;/a&gt;, it's over a mile deep, comprised of an ancient rift valley where the Earth's crust is pulling apart at two centimeters per year. As the rift has expanded over the millenia, it has filled in with a layer of sediment that is now four miles deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its extreme age (25-30 million years) and isolation from other bodies of water, Lake Baikal has developed many unique species that are unlike any found elsewhere, and is therefore often called the &quot;Galapagos of Russia&quot;. The lake is home to a species of freshwater seal, as well as the translucent Baikal oil fish, known for liquefying into a slurry of oil and bones when dredged up from the extreme pressures at the depths of the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Most Unwanted Song</title>

   <updated>2008-04-22T12:17:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/04/22/the-most-unwanted-song</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, artists &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diacenter.org/km/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vitaly Komar and Alex Melamid&lt;/a&gt;, along with composer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Soldier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Soldier&lt;/a&gt;, polled 500 music listeners to determine the least desirable musical qualities. They compiled their data and then composed a piece of music that incorporated as many of these qualities as possible, titling the final product &quot;The Most Unwanted Song&quot;. The folks polled apparently don't like rap music, sopranos, or songs about cowboys, so their song prominently features a soprano rapping about cowboys. Other features include tubas, banjos, accordions, sudden changes in dynamics and tempo, children's choirs singing about holidays (Labor Day, Ramadan) and corporations (Wal Mart, Coca Cola), and an uncomfortable length of 25 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result, in my opinion, is catchy and fascinating - much more than the sum of its unwanted parts. If you've ever enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/musica?aid=m0nZM7fvINH&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=music&amp;amp;ct=result&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. Bungle&lt;/a&gt;, I think you'll love this song. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/04/a-scientific-at.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stream it from the Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.wired.com/music/files/KomarMelamid_The-Most-UnwantedSong.mp3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download the MP3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The V-2 Rocket</title>

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/04/22/the-v-2-rocket</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_rocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;V-2 rocket&lt;/a&gt;, produced by Nazi Germany during World War II, was the first man-made object to achieve suborbital spaceflight and was the precursor to all modern rockets, including those used for human spaceflight. Germany launched over 3,000 of them at Allied countries up through 1945, claiming 7,000 military and civilian lives, mostly in London and Antwerp, as well the 25,000 slave laborers who died while being forced to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-foot-long rocket's liquid oxygen-fueled engine would burn for only about 65 seconds before cutting off, using two gyroscopes and a simple analog computer to determine the exact angle of the rocket at the moment the engine cut off. The rocket then followed a purely ballistic trajectory the rest of the way to its destination, sometimes landing within meters of its target. The V-2 had a range of up to 200 miles at an altitude of 55 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the rockets fell in London, there would be no warning before the explosion, as the V-2 traveled at supersonic speeds. Just after the explosion, a characteristic fading whistling sound could often be heard. In fact, the British government denied that the city was under rocket attack until it had been going on for weeks, instead attributing the explosions to other causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Germany fell to the Allied troops in 1945, the V-2's creator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wernher von Braun&lt;/a&gt;, and his whole team surrendered to the Americans in order to prevent their technology from going to the Russians. Von Braun went on to create the rockets first used by the fledgling US space program, including the giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saturn V&lt;/a&gt; rocket that took astronauts to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

Cooper&lt;/a&gt; was the alias of a man who hijacked a Boeing 727 in 1972 and then disappeared after parachuting out of the plane. The dapper man in a crisp suit passed a note to a flight attendant claiming he had a bomb in his suitcase. He demanded $200,000 in unmarked $20 bills, and four parachutes. After the plane landed and officials met his demands, he released the passengers and told the crew to take the plane back into the air. Then, somewhere over the Pacific Northwest, he opened the rear stairway of the plane and, strapped into a parachute and clutching the briefcase full of cash, leapt into a furious rainstorm, never to be seen again. It is unknown if he survived the jump, but in 1980 about $5000 of the bills he had been given by the FBI were found in the mud on the banks of the Columbia river. It is not known if they were buried or just washed up there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley company &lt;a href=&quot;http://luxim.com&quot; title=&quot;Luxim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Luxim&lt;/a&gt; has created the most efficient light source yet, at 140 lumens (units of light output) per watt. For comparison, today's most efficient LEDs only produce 70 lumens per watt, and a normal incandescent bulb produces a measly 15. They have produced a bulb the size of a Tic Tac that produces as much light as a street lamp using a fraction of the power. They use an electrical charge tightly focused into a small capsule of argon gas. The argon turns into a 6000 degree plasma, as hot as the surface of the sun - which is the reason why the light it emits has the same spectrum as natural sunlight.

As if being the lead singer for Iron Maiden wasn't awesome enough, Bruce was also really into fencing and competed internationally, and started his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww.duellist.com&quot; title=&quot;Duellist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fencing equipment company&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Music software company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celemony.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Celemony&lt;/a&gt; has announced the latest version of their pitch correction software, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=dna&quot; title=&quot;Melodyne DNA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Melodyne&lt;/a&gt;. While it's been possible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_correction&quot; title=&quot;pitch correction on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quite some time&lt;/a&gt; to use software to correct or change an individual note in a recorded melody, until now it's only been able to do that with a monophonic melody, meaning only one note is playing at a time, such as a voice or a flute. The breakthrough is that they've finally made it possible to actually access all of the notes in a polyphonic recording, such as a strumming guitar or a chorus of voices. The software extracts each note and displays it in a grid, where time goes from left to right and pitch goes from bottom to top. You can then select each individual note with your mouse and move it up or down in pitch, forward or backwards in time, adjust it louder or quieter in volume. You can use this as a tool to make subtle corrections, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=dna_intro3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a whole new piece&lt;/a&gt; with the same instrument.

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/02/01/frozen-grand-central</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is just too cool for words. One winter day in New York City, 207 people casually wandered into Grand Central Station. At exactly 2:30 pm, they all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central/://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;froze in place&lt;/a&gt; like statues, confusing the many bystanders and official-looking people around them. Exactly 5 minutes later, they all continued on with their business as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance was organized by a group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.improveverywhere.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Improv Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, which has pulled off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.improveverywhere.com/2004/07/24/synchronized-swimming/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many such stunts&lt;/a&gt; over the past several years.

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/01/28/scientology</id>
   <content type="html">The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1953 by science fiction author &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of his self-help book &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dianetics&lt;/a&gt;. That book claimed that all of a person's psychological problems can be traced back to unconscious traumatic memories. Scientology teaches that those traumas were actually experienced by (or implanted into) the thousands of alien spirits that have possessed each person's body. The eventual goal of a Scientologist is to purge those alien spirits in order to achieve what is known as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_%28Scientology%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;State of Clear&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;

The centerpiece of the vast &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera_in_Scientology_doctrine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Space Opera&lt;/a&gt;&quot; mythology that the Scientology &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;belief system&lt;/a&gt; is based on is the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://xenu.net/archive/leaflet/xenuleaf.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xenu&lt;/a&gt;, which Hubbard authored in 1967 under the title &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OT III&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The story was kept secret from the public and from low-level Church members until it was entered as evidence in a 1985 court case and subsequently revealed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/latimes-1985.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;.

About 75 million years ago, Xenu was the alien ruler of the Galactic Confederacy, which consisted of 76 planets, including Earth (known then as &quot;Teegeeack&quot;). Each planet was home to an average of 178 billion people. In order to deal with this critical overpopulation, Xenu recruited psychologists to bring billions of people in for what they were told would be income tax inspections. Those people were then injected with a paralyzing solution and loaded on space planes which looked very much like the 1960s-era &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Douglas DC-8&lt;/a&gt;, then flown to planet Earth, and then stacked around the bases of volcanoes such as Loa, Vesuvius, Shasta, Washington, Fujiyama, Etna, and many others. Xenu lowered hydrogen bombs into the volcanoes and detonated them, killing everyone.

However, the billions of disembodied alien souls (known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_thetan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thetans&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in Scientology-speak) began to float around on the nuclear winds, and Xenu worried that they would try to come back for revenge. So he captured all of the souls using special &quot;sticky&quot; electronic beams, loaded them into boxes, took them to huge cinemas, and made them watch 3-D propaganda films designed to confuse them by implanting all sorts of preposterous ideas about God, the Devil, and Christ, among others. When the films were over, these confused souls thought they were all the same person and therefore clustered together by the thousands. And each cluster of thousands eventually inhabited one of the few remaining living bodies on earth.

Scientology teaches that you and I, until we have achieved the State of Clear, are to this day still being controlled by the traumas and propaganda that were fed to these body thetans by Xenu (including our belief in God), and will continue to be controlled until we have taken the many levels of expensive &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditing_%28Scientology%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;auditing&lt;/a&gt;&quot; courses offered by the Church that are designed to set us free. The final level of training, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OT_VIII&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OT VIII&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &quot;The Truth Revealed&quot;, can only take place on Scientology's luxury cruise ship, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freewinds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freewinds.&lt;/a&gt; It costs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xenu.net/archive/prices.html&quot; title=&quot;ASHO price list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$10,000&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Thought Experiment #1: The End of Friction</title>
   <link href="http://toasthaiku.net/2008/01/24/thought-experiment-1-the-end-of-friction.html"/>
   <updated>2008-01-24T12:42:43-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/01/24/thought-experiment-1-the-end-of-friction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;December 21, 2012, marks the end of the 12th b'ak'tun of the ancient &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mayan Long Count calendar&lt;/a&gt;. Some unimaginative types speculate that the start of the 13th b'ak'tun, the last day of the Mayan calendar, signifies some sort of transfiguring shift, such as a world-ending catastrophe, perhaps at the hands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to propose a much more novel shift: the End of Friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At midnight on December 21, 2012, all friction that exists between physical objects will vanish entirely. And so begins the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unsuspecting human sitting in a chair at that moment will notice this peculiar change immediately. His zipper will suddenly come undone. His glasses will slide off of his face. His shoes will come untied. In fact, all of his fabric-based clothes will suddenly disintegrate into a pile of loose fibers, since friction was the only thing holding them together. And that pile of fibers will quickly flatten itself across the entire surface of the floor. At that point, he will slide off of his chair, unless he has his fingers securely hooked around its legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he would have bigger things to worry about than sliding butt-naked onto the floor. The hot and cold faucets suddenly turn on full blast, right as the pipes themselves unscrew and clang to the ground. All of the nails and all of the screws that are holding his house together suddenly start falling out of the wood (well, only those that were installed with their tips pointing upwards). His plastic raincoat, however, stays hanging securely from its loop on the coat rack - and his loose change is staying put in its jar. Which just slid off his not-quite-level dresser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he were able to escape his disintegrating house in time (perhaps by blowing air to propel his naked self across the floor and out the front door), he would find the outside world faring no better. Balloons untie themselves and splutter away from crying children. Dogs' leashes slip out of their owners' hands, leaving them to scuffle excitedly in place as if the sidewalk were a slick hardwood floor (a sensation not foreign to most dogs). Moving cars are dropping parts until they're not much more than an engine block and tires skidding along the asphalt in a pool of bolts, axels, mirrors, and body panels. Street signs are dropping from their posts, and the posts themselves (those not embedded in concrete) are toppling to the ground as dirt and gravel begin to liquify like quicksand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overhead, birds circle bemusedly, not quite sure what to make of the chaos below. Although an osprey might begin to wonder why it dropped the delicious bass it just caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhausted citizens of Earth swim through the oceans of debris and begin to gather on islands of bedrock and concrete. They must rebuild their civilization under these new physical rules. Clothes may no longer be made of thread and zippers, but rather sheets of plastic and seaweed held taut by hooks and buttons. Homes must be built of solid interlocking parts held in place by tension and gravity. Transportation is made possible only by harnessing the power of the wind, or just flopping around a lot until you end up somewhere new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to just find yourself a nice shallow depression in the bedrock where you can curl up with your seaweed blanket and a good book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the next b'ak'tun will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blackbeard the Pirate&lt;/a&gt; was a total badass. His real name was Edward Teach, but nobody is sure if he was born in London, Bristol, Philadelphia, or Jamaica. His reign of terror lasted only about six years, from 1713 to 1718, in the seas between the Bahamas and the Carolinas. In particular, he spent a lot of time terrorizing the coast of North Carolina, and even delivered booty to governor Charles Eden in exchange for protection and an official pardon. In 1718, he blockaded Charleston Harbor in South Carolina, plundering five merchant vessels before he was through. Later that year, Blackbeard met his end at the hands of British Lieutenant Robert Maynard when a price of 100 pounds was put on his head. According to legend, in his final battle Blackbeard was shot five times and stabbed more than 20 times before he went down, and his headless body is said to have swum circles around his ship seven times before it sank.

However, it is unclear who would have won had he done &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ninjapirate.com/battle.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;battle with ninjas&lt;/a&gt;. Arrrr!!!

   <updated>2008-01-06T13:50:38-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2008/01/06/mormonism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Latter Day Saint movement&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1827 by New Yorker &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joseph Smith, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;  In the early 1820s, Smith was paid to (mostly unsuccessfully) attempt to find lost items and buried treasures by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stones_and_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peering into stones&lt;/a&gt; and finding the necessary information contained in the stone's reflections.

Smith said that an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; visited him in 1823 and told him of a set of inscribed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;golden plates&lt;/a&gt; buried in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt; near his home in Western New York, which he unearthed in 1827.  Smith transcribed them as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/a&gt; before returning them to the angel.  To translate the inscriptions, which were written in 400 AD by a pre-Columbian &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_%28prophet%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; in a language Smith called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Egyptian&quot;&gt;Reformed Egyptian&lt;/a&gt;, he used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two stones bound by silver bows&lt;/a&gt; which he found along with the plates.  He would place the stones in his hat, bury his face in the hat, and dictate the text to his wife.  Meanwhile the plates themselves lay wrapped in linen, sometimes in another room.

Smith published the Book of Mormon in 1830.  According to the book, Israelite tribes traveled by boat to America before the birth of Jesus, and Native Americans are actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_the_Book_of_Mormon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;descendants of Israelites&lt;/a&gt;.  They brought horses and steel and other things not known to exist in the Americas at that time.  After the death and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_Resurrection_of_Jesus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resurrection of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; in the New Testament, Jesus came to America to repeat his teachings to the lost tribes of Israel and to establish a peaceful society (which didn't last).  God lives on a planet called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kolob&lt;/a&gt;, where a day lasts a thousand years (according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcriptions&lt;/a&gt; Smith made of Egyptian scrolls that came through his town in an 1835 traveling mummy exhibition).

Mormons who have participated in a special &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_and_anointing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temple ceremony&lt;/a&gt; to prepare themselves to be &quot;kings and priests&quot; or &quot;queens and priestesses&quot;  in the afterlife wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_garment&quot;&gt;sacred knee-high undergarments&lt;/a&gt; under their clothes at all times.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; has over 13 million members worldwide.  There exists &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatismormonism.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some criticism&lt;/a&gt; of the Mormon movement.

   <content type="html">In the middle of the 15th century, Korea was still using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chinese characters&lt;/a&gt; for their written language, despite having a very different spoken language.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;King Sejong&lt;/a&gt; argued that the Chinese script, with its thousands of characters, was too complicated for commoners to learn and was awkward due to the differences between spoken Chinese and Korean.  So in 1446 he published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunmin_Jeongeum&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating a new writing system, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt;, which used only 51 characters, making it much easier to learn.  24 of the characters map closely to letters of the Latin alphabet.  The most interesting part is that the characters are drawn to show the way the lips and tongue are positioned to form the sound, enabling non-native speakers to sound out words without extensive training.

   <title>Word Generator</title>
   <link href="http://toasthaiku.net/2007/12/28/word-generator.html"/>
   <updated>2007-12-28T18:17:13-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2007/12/28/word-generator</id>
   <content type="html">Indromia, Quard, Conistate, Vercurelince, Quiniferphose!

In an inexplicable fit of word geekery, I wrote a program to generate new words via a statistical analysis of existing words.  First I generated a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry for &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;histogram&lt;/a&gt; to count the number of times each possible three-letter combination occurs at the beginnings, middles, or ends of existing words.  Then, to generate a new word, the program tries random overlapping three-letter combinations until each of their frequencies of occurrence in the histogram is above a specified threshold.  Isn't that idimogous?

Go ahead and give it a try below!  You can specify a &quot;normalness&quot; scaling factor (5 gives very daisewisfasy-sounding words, 95 gives very conistate-sounding words), a maximum word length, a minimum word length, the source text for the statistical analysis (choose from the dictionary, the Bible, the complete works of William Shakespeare, etc), and an optional &quot;seed&quot; word for the generator to build upon (seeding with &quot;muffin&quot; could yield the wonderful &quot;Muffinetry&quot;).

Oh, and I also made a variation that uses U.S. Census data to generate new baby names (just click on &quot;names&quot;).

   <content type="html">&lt;a href=&quot;http://flam3.com&quot; title=&quot;flam3.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flam3&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia entry for &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fractal&lt;/a&gt; art generator written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://draves.org/&quot; title=&quot;draves.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scott Draves&lt;/a&gt;.  It's also the heart of a collaborative screen saver called &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricsheep.org/&quot; title=&quot;electricsheep.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Electric Sheep&lt;/a&gt; (named after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F&quot; title=&quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Philip K. Dick novel&lt;/a&gt;).  While a beautiful fractal animation plays on the user's screen, their computer is simultaneously rendering a few new frames for a future animation.  Each computer uploads its new frames to a server, and in return downloads new animations that were created by the distributed network.  These &quot;electric sheep&quot; are the &quot;dreams&quot; of the sleeping machines.

A program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxidizer.sourceforge.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oxidizer&lt;/a&gt; (Mac) lets you edit those animations and create your own - or render single frames as high-resolution artwork.  (You could also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://apophysis.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apophysis&lt;/a&gt; for Windows, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://students.washington.edu/bitsed/qosmic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qosmic&lt;/a&gt; for Linux).  To get started, browse the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheepserver.net/v2d6/cgi/status.cgi&quot; title=&quot;sheepserver.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;current flock&lt;/a&gt; of sheep.  Click on one you like, download its &quot;genome&quot;, load it up in Oxidizer and start playing around with its genes (here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rampant-mac.com/wp/?p=191&quot; title=&quot;Oxidizer tutorial&quot;&gt;nice tutorial&lt;/a&gt;).  You can even cross-breed multiple sheep to create a hybrid.  When you come up with something you like, you can render it as an animation or still frame.  There are infinite variations to be made, so have at it!  Oh, and did I mention that all of this software is free?

&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://draves.org&quot;&gt;Scott Draves&lt;/a&gt; just pointed me to a preview of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://draves.org/blog/archives/000498.html&quot; title=&quot;Electric Sheep v2.7 teaser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;next version&lt;/a&gt; of Electric Sheep, featuring even higher quality animations.  Thanks, Spot!

   <title>Your Own Personal Wiki</title>

   <updated>2007-12-23T17:10:40-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2007/12/23/your-own-personal-wiki</id>
   <content type="html">Wherever I am, I can type &quot;w recipes&quot; into my browser's address bar and get an editable list of recipes I've tried and liked.  If I type &quot;w books&quot; I get a list of books people have told me to read.  Or &quot;w rails&quot; to see the notes I've been taking as I've been learning to program in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;.  I can also do this from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.com/iphone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://toast.dj/q.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;special search page I made&lt;/a&gt;.

What's a Wiki?  It's the same kind of software that runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; - it's easy for anyone to view and edit pages, whether or not you already know how to make web pages.  But you can have your very own wiki, and you can keep others from being able to view or change it.  Then a Wiki becomes a useful tool to organize your information, and have it accessible from wherever you are.

The software that runs Wikipedia is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediawiki.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;.  It's free, but it's tricky to set up and probably overkill for you.  I'm using a simple wiki called &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevenf.com/2007/07/w2_a_little_wiki_1.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;W2 by Steven Frank&lt;/a&gt;, which is optimized to look good on standard web browsers as well as on iPhone.  If you have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?106199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web hosting provider&lt;/a&gt; (and who doesn't these days, right?), you just upload &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/w2wiki/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the files&lt;/a&gt; to your site (it's written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;), optionally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;password protect it using an .htaccess&lt;/a&gt; file, optionally &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnbokma.com/firefox/keymarks-explained.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;set up a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnbokma.com/firefox/keymarks-explained.html&quot;&gt;Quick Search&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox (so you can just type &quot;w&quot; instead of &quot;http://yoursite.com/index.php/&quot;), and you're good to go.  It saves files as plain text, no databases to muck around with.

I use it every day.

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2007/12/23/series-hybrids</id>
   <content type="html">Unlike today's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;parallel hybrid&lt;/a&gt;&quot; cars, where a normal gas engine and an electric motor are both mechanically connected to the wheels, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070906.002/volvo-c30-recharge-concept-at-frankfurt&quot;&gt;Volvo C-30 Recharge Concept&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;series hybrid&lt;/a&gt;&quot; has four electric motors, one in each wheel well, and a diesel engine that isn't connected to the wheels - its only job is to act as a generator and recharge the batteries when they are low, or send electricity to the wheel motors if the batteries are empty.

The car can travel 60 miles on batteries alone before the engine kicks in - and since you can recharge it by plugging it in at night, that means if you drive less than 60 miles a day, you'll never need to buy gas.  And in a 93 mile drive starting with full batteries and a full tank, you would effectively get 124 miles per gallon.  (Yes, that electricity from your wall probably doesn't come carbon-free, but even if 100% of it comes from coal-fired plants, your overall emissions will still be far less than a conventional gas engine.)

Sadly, this car exists only in a test version, and may never reach production.  However, GM is using the same basic design in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gm-volt.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Volt&lt;/a&gt; hybrid car, with just slightly lower specs, which is entering production and should be available by 2010.

New digital processing techniques are used which result in smooth motion, unlike the normal fast-forward that we are used to.  Scheduled for exhibition in galleries and on HD-DVD in 2008.

   <title>The Cat's Snowflakes</title>

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2005/11/23/the-cats-snowflakes</id>
   <content type="html">I was assisting a group of scientists in performing a behavioral experiment.  We would pick up a large, thin sheet of translucent rainbow-colored material by its edges and follow a cat around the room with it.  When the cat stopped, we held the sheet of material just above it.  The material would then melt onto the floor around the cat, and the multi-colored droplets on the floor would then start to arrange themselves into a symmetrical pattern, like a giant snowflake.  The cat would watch the pattern taking shape, and would then use its paws to help complete the design, pushing the droplets along to their final positions before they solidified.  When the pattern was complete, we would pick up the new solid sheet of material, the cat would begin to wander, and we would follow it around until it stopped.  Then we would hold the sheet over the cat, the sheet would melt, and the cycle would repeat.Eventually the cat grew tired of the game, and refused to stay under the sheet.  &quot;Looks like the jig is up,&quot; I said.

   <title>Red Birds</title>

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2005/05/28/red-birds</id>
   <content type="html">I was holding a device that I had somehow reconfigured such that when I pushed its button, it would cause a bird to slowly fly down from its perch over a reflecting pool, perform a series of graceful swoops and curves, touch the surface of the water, and finally return to its perch - after which it would dive down again and continuously repeat the pattern.  Every time I pushed the button, it would cause another bird to appear, in a different shade of brilliant red, yellow, or orange.  Each new bird would begin perched next to the previous bird, and would then begin to perform the same flight in the same pattern, but in just a slightly offset position. I began to push the button as rapidly as I could, until there were hundreds of birds.  At first they were spread out in a continuous ribbon that flowed in a slow, shimmering loop.  But after a while, they began to synchronize to each other such that they resembled a giant flickering smear that would start up at the perch and pour itself through the air above the reflecting pool.It was beautiful to watch, but somehow in the back of my mind I knew I was breaking a rule.  My fears were confirmed when a crowd began to gather, and an old man in a raincoat curiously stepped close to the path of the birds.  When the flickering red smear passed by him, they caught the edge of his coat and lifted him off the ground.  They continued along their usual path, and when they returned to their perch, I could see that he was being crushed as they pulled him through an obstruction above the perch.

I knew that the shocked crowd was about to come after me, so I put the device to my ear as if calling for help and began to run.

   <title>Lucid Dreaming</title>
   <link href="http://toasthaiku.net/2000/10/18/lucid-dreaming.html"/>

   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/2000/10/18/lucid-dreaming</id>
   <content type="html">Some friends and I were experiencing a particularly bizarre sequence of events, when suddenly I realized, &quot;This is way too ridiculous, we must be dreaming.&quot;

When I expressed my revelation to my friends, they all shook their heads in shock and wonderment and congratulated me on my insight. We then proceeded to occupy our idle minds by performing such tricks as levitating objects and eating giant strawberries.

However, I then had another realization. I asked my companions, &quot;Don't you think it's a bit odd that we're all having the same dream?&quot;

We all agreed that this was not very likely, and that in reality it must be only one of us that was having the dream. I personally was fairly sure that it was me, since I knew that I was self-aware, which should theoretically prove my existence under René Descartes' philosophical statement, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;

However, my companions resisted the idea that I was the one having the dream and that the rest of them didn't exist. Being not totally convinced myself, I asked one of them the following question:

&quot;So in your mind, you are totally convinced that you are self-aware, that you are the one having a dream, and that the rest of us are just constructs of your imagination?&quot;

She thought briefly and replied, &quot;Yes, I am.&quot;

This made me begin to seriously doubt my own existence.

But then I woke up, and my first conscious thought was, &quot;Whew! It WAS me!&quot;

   <title>Soup in the South</title>

   <updated>1998-10-23T10:42:08-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://toasthaiku.net/1998/10/23/soup-in-the-south</id>
   <content type="html">While visiting a large, comfortable house somewhere in the South, I very unwisely chose to climb into a bathtub of chicken soup while fully clothed.  I soon realized the folly of my situation, but fortunately there was a second bathroom right across the hallway where I could go to clean myself up.

While in this second bathroom, I looked at myself in the mirror. I was drenched with chicken soup, and had had several days of beard stubble. As I focused on my image, I realized I was beginning to levitate above the floor by sheer will power. I floated throughout the bathroom, occasionally hovering near the window to see the beautiful sunset that was taking place outside. I found I could also levitate miscellaneous small objects in the bathroom with my mind, such as towels, and toss them about, leaving the room in a state of disarray.

Then I found that I was outside. I flew over the hills and fields, remarking at the colorful landscape and winding roads. When later I returned to the house, I met a friend outside who suggested that I join her in a walk to her house in Oakland. I told her I still really needed to clean myself up, as the chicken soup I was drenched in had now become raw egg. I also decided that since I didn't remember coming outside, I must still be in the bathroom, projecting myself outside psychically.

When I brought her to the bathroom to prove my strange claim, to my surprise, I wasn't already in there. But there were several startled people lounging amid the disarray I had earlier created.

Later, I sat on the porch with the house's matron, discussing the constant arguments and disagreements she had with her daughter. While absently brushing a white long-stemmed flower against the steps, I gave her some very sage advice on how her daughter just needed to be herself.

   <title>Bananas and Spielberg</title>

   <content type="html">As I was getting slightly drunk with wine at a social gathering, a friend told me he desperately needed my help. One of the performers in the dance routine scheduled for that evening didn't show up, and he needed me to fill in. There was no time to rehearse.

Several minutes later, I found myself on stage, dressed up in a banana suit, trying to follow the movements of the other dancers. I stumbled around the stage, cursing my luck. But after the grand finale, the audience burst into thunderous applause.

Later, still slightly tipsy, I wandered along the waterfront until I happened upon Steven Spielberg, who was relaxing with my dad and uncle on the cluttered patio of a condo.

They invited me to catch a movie with them.

   <title>Abalone Fisherwoman</title>

   <content type="html">I was rudely awakened by little bits of the ceiling falling on my bed. Apparently my upstairs neighbors were doing some &quot;improvements&quot; and were creating a widening hole in the ceiling and adjacent wall above me.

I quickly stumbled out of bed. My bleary eyes watched as the rapidly widening hole started to reveal the structural skeleton of the building, and light began to stream through the gaps.

Soon the hole was large enough that an abalone fisherwoman in a wetsuit was able to fall through.

She was as surprised as I was.

   <content type="html">I was working as a temp for Michael Douglas at a large corporation, doing research on using tofu as a meat substitute in cooking. As I was chasing after Mr. Douglas with my stack of notes, I ran into Julia Roberts. Then it occurred to me that this must be the making of a movie.

&quot;Hello, Miss Roberts,&quot; I said politely, in awe of her greatness.

&quot;Please, it's Julia,&quot; she answered with a smile.

&quot;This movie flopped, didn't it? I've never heard of it before,&quot; I said.

&quot;Actually, it's still being made,&quot; she answered.

I felt like such an idiot.

   <title>Meat Loaf Recipes of the Old West</title>

   <content type="html">I was sitting in a nicely furnished living room with Joan Collins and some guy I didn't know (I assumed he was a friend of Joan). We were all armed with automatic weapons, and we were calmly firing blanks at each other's heads.

Now, this house was built on one of those circular iceplant-filled areas inside of a freeway onramp, so out of all the windows we had a view of the surrounding stop-and-go traffic. The outer perimeter of the onramp was lined with enormous state-owned bookcases filled with enormous state-owned books (I knew they were put there because the onramp is state property, obviously). I only read the title of one of the enormous books (about 4 inches wide by 4 feet high), and the title was &quot;Meat Loaf Recipes of the Old West&quot;.
